Multiplayer

Core engine enhancements:
 At occluded siblings of "pause" nodes, postpone computer move until node becomes visible
 Allow Boolean comparison expressions in ParamFunc's
 Click, which triggers code for expanding tree, also broadcasts message (yielding a promise)
   Text default color is bright-red (unless number of players = 1, in which case it's black)
    Visual feedback when promise fulfilled: text fades from bright-red to somewhat-red
 Receiving nodes on channels gives visual feedback:
   Visual feedback when node received in peer message: text fades to faintly-red
   Visual feedback when node received in message from player 1: text fades to black
