Allow players to change names via textbox on multiplayer menu screen

FunkScene-style menus (c.f. ChoiceScript)

At occluded siblings of "pause" nodes, postpone computer move until node becomes visible
Allow comparison ParamFunc's, e.g. "$a > $b", yielding 1 or 0

Allow weights on human-played rules, determining (a) if rule is visible, (b) what order rules are presented in

Allow sym_modifiers in grammar (NontermReference in code) to specify a role that overrides nonterminal role
 e.g. "@battle#2" or "@test#3;"

In Node constructor, parentRole should be replaced by olderSiblingOrParentRole
 i.e. "#=", "#+" and "#-" should be relative to older sibling's role, where available
 this makes for a fairer distribution of turns

Input nodes e.g. "$variable=?" generates a textbox
 array version "$variable[$index]=?"  ... note the index could change dynamically; I guess this is OK
 with commit modifier "$variable=?!" means you can only edit it once, reducing parent node's unexpandedChildren count
 without commit modifier, it can be edited at any time, multiple times

Fix "Evaluates to..." in debugger parse tree view, for array variables e.g. $#sc in GoodNews/BadNews
Add missing auto-renaming functionality to Editor (ParamAssignments & ParamReferences in rhs of rules)

Private nodes, whose immediate text children (preamble, placeholder, terminals) are only visible to owner

More visual feedback on network operations
 Click, which triggers code for expanding tree, also broadcasts message (yielding a promise)
   Text default color is bright-red (unless number of players = 1, in which case it's black)
    Visual feedback when promise fulfilled: text fades from bright-red to somewhat-red
 Receiving nodes on channels gives visual feedback:
   Visual feedback when node received in peer message: text fades to faintly-red
   Visual feedback when node received in message from player 1: text fades to black

Extend $variable[$#] pseudo-array syntax to allow any index, dynamically computed
  This will require a new kind of ParamAssignment e.g. ArrayParamAssignment, where array index is a ParamFunc
   Ditto a new kind of ParamReference e.g. ArrayParamReference
ParamFunc for string concatenation

Role names
 e.g. "roles {Optimist Pessimist}" as alternative syntax to "roles 2"
  can then refer to roles by name e.g. "#Optimist" instead of "#1"
 Drag-and-drop editable role list for Editor
  auto-replace of role names throughout text, when edited
