<h1>FunkScene</h1>

<p>FunkScene is a dialect of JavaScript intended to encourage functional
programming in the creation of choose-your-own (CYO) interactive fiction.</p>

<p>Most JavaScript programs are valid FunkScene programs. In addition,
FunkScene provides a few macros to construct the staples of CYO fiction:
passages of text <em>("scenes")</em> with choices that lead to other scenes.</p>

<p>This is not a full tutorial, but a quick-start guide for experienced JavaScript programmers.</p>

</ul>

<p>An earlier prototype, <a href="https://github.com/ihh/schooz">Schooz</a>, developed the functional programming framework
while also exploring some alternative UI ideas (such as dropdown menus) that were eventually omitted from this framework.</p>

<h2>Scene functions</h2>

<p>The fundamental concept in the FunkScene JavaScript API is the <em>"scene function".</em>
A scene function returns a piece of <em>scene text</em>
(e.g. "You are in Melchior's Dungeon.")
along with a list of <em>choices</em>, each of which consists of a <em>choice text</em>
(e.g. "I pick up the mottled axe.")
and another <em>scene function</em>
(the next scene that's going to be displayed if the player makes that choice).</p>

<h2>Aesthetics</h2>

<p>A scene is always presented as a scene text followed by a choice list.
There are currently no inline hyperlinks or dropdown menus in FunkScene.
While links encourage close examination of a text, and indeed add extra semantics, they can detract from the pace of a story and the balancing of choices.
A strict separation of scene and choices is restrictive in some ways, but it simplifies the syntax, and this helps the story flow.</p>

<p>The design philosophy of FunkScene is</p>

<ol>
<li>a simple wiki-like syntax for building CYO stories (building on predecessor languages such as ChoiceScript and Twine)</li>
<li>an emphasis on choice lists (c.f. ChoiceScript) over hyperlinks (Twine) and drop-down menus (Schooz)</li>
<li>a functional programming style (building on an earlier prototype, Schooz)</li>
</ol>

<h2>FunkScene language</h2>

<p>FunkScene is JavaScript, plus a few keywords for constructing scene
functions, and a small amount of boilerplate code for hooking up scene
text and choice list to the DOM.</p>

<p>The following FunkScene describes a tiny story composed of three
vanilla scene functions, with one choice-point:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads "BEWARE!"
#CHOOSE I smash the gates! #FOR electrified
#CHOOSE I walk away #FOR wise_choice
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE electrified
#SCENE Several amps flow through your body.
Think that doesn't sound like a lot? No, you don't think that, because you're dead.
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE wise_choice
#SCENE A wise choice, my friend.
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't look much like JavaScript, because it isn't: this program
uses only the constructs added by FunkScene. Incidentally, all FunkScene keywords
begin with a <code>#</code>; if you need to use an actual hash symbol in your
JavaScript or your text, escape it as <code>\#</code>. A backslash itself is <code>\\</code>.
Hash signs followed by numbers, like <code>#1</code>, do not need to be escaped;
nor do isolated hashes followed by whitespace, or runs of hashes.
This means you can use Markdown, which is handy, because Markdown is the default preprocessor for scene text.</p>

<h2>JavaScript object code</h2>

<p>FunkScene is compiled internally to JavaScript. The Temple of Belsidore
compiles to the following:</p>

<pre><code>start = function() {
    return ["You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads \"BEWARE!\"",
            [["I smash the gates!", electrified],
             ["I walk away", wise_choice]]];
};

electrified = function() {
    return ["Several amps flow through your body. Think that doesn't sound like a lot? No, you don't think that, because you're dead.",
         []];
};

wise_choice = function() {
    return ["A wise choice, my friend.",
     []];
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the quotation marks around <code>"BEWARE!"</code> do not need to be escaped in the
FunkScene macro; they are automatically escaped in the compiled
JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Playing the game</h2>

<p>To play the Temple of Belsidore "game", you will need to save it with a filename like
<code>mygame.scene</code> and then edit the supplied <code>index.html</code> file to contain the following
(after all other <code>script</code> and <code>link</code> blocks):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  loadSceneFile ("mygame.scene");
  initialize();
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll then need to open <code>index.html</code> over a web connection (i.e. an
<code>http</code> URL, not a <code>file</code> URL, because the <code>loadSceneFile</code> function
needs to do an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>). So you'll need to put the
<code>funkscene</code> directory somewhere web-servable, or create a symlink.</p>

<h2>General format of a scene declaration</h2>

<p>The general format of the FunkScene <code>#PAGE...#SCENE...#ENDSCENE</code> macro,
which constructs a scenefunction and assigns it to a JavaScript <code>var</code> (the <em>"page variable"</em> ),
is as follows (NB newlines are not significant, they are treated
exactly the same as any other whitespace):</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE &lt;name of page variable&gt;
#SCENE &lt;...scene text...&gt;
#CHOOSE &lt;...choice text...&gt; #FOR &lt;name of target page variable&gt;
#CHOOSE &lt;...more choice text...&gt; #FOR &lt;another page variable name&gt;
 &lt;more #CHOOSE...#FOR... blocks here, if you want them&gt;
 &lt;...&gt;
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>#(...#)</code> in place of <code>#SCENE...#ENDSCENE</code>, if cryptic
uber-efficiency via punctuation is your thing. (Actually, this has an
added benefit that you can use many text editors'
parenthesis-balancing feature to check that your brackets match.)</p>

<h2>Anonymous scene functions</h2>

<p>You can declare scenes in nested (inline) fashion, as well as
standalone blocks. For example:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads "BEWARE!"
#CHOOSE I smash the gates! #FOR electrified
#CHOOSE I walk away #FOR
 #SCENE Are you sure?
 #CHOOSE Yes #FOR wise_choice
 #CHOOSE No #FOR start
 #ENDSCENE
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>...or...</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads "BEWARE!"
#CHOOSE I smash the gates! #FOR electrified
#CHOOSE I walk away #FOR
 #( Are you sure?
  #CHOOSE Yes #FOR wise_choice
  #CHOOSE No #FOR start
 #)
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<h2>Choices that can be disabled but still visible</h2>

<p>The choice can be prefixed by <code>#IF &lt;JavaScript expression&gt;</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#IF &lt;JavaScript expression&gt; #CHOOSE &lt;text&gt; #FOR &lt;page variable name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or the anonymous version (no page variable)</p>

<pre><code>#IF &lt;JavaScript expression&gt; #CHOOSE &lt;text&gt; #FOR #( &lt;scene&gt; #)
</code></pre>

<h2>Choices that are invisible when disabled</h2>

<pre><code>#SECRETLY #IF &lt;expression&gt; #CHOOSE &lt;text&gt; #FOR &lt;page variable name&gt;
#SECRETLY #IF &lt;expression&gt; #CHOOSE &lt;text&gt; #FOR #( &lt;scene&gt; #)
</code></pre>

<h2>Beginnings, endings, middles</h2>

<p>Note that one of the scene functions is called <code>start</code>; regardless of
where it is declared in the program, this will always be the first
scene the player sees.</p>

<p>The other two scenes (page variables <code>electrified</code> and <code>wise_choice</code>) are
<em>dead-ends:</em> they have zero choices available to the player, and are therefore
interpreted as game-ending scenes (unless there is an implicit continuation;
see below). You can optionally add the keyword <code>#OVER</code> at the end of
a dead-end scene, to indicate that this was a deliberate dead-end and
the game is over at that point (this will overrule the implicit continuation,
if there is one).</p>

<p>For middle passages, i.e. scenes that have only one choice, you can
either list a single choice, emphasizing that the player is taking the
only course of action available:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE hanging_on
#SCENE You hang onto the ledge for as long as possible,
  but the pain is unbearable. Eventually you have no choice but to...
#CHOOSE ...let go #FOR #( You let go, and plummet to your doom. #)
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can use the special <code>#GOTO</code> keyword, which hides the choice list
altogether, but still forces the player to click a button to move to the next
scene:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE drink_wine
#SCENE The wine burns the back of your throat. Poison! You reach for
 the door, but your legs buckle and the door-handle recedes down a
 tunnel as you slip into unconsciousness...
#GOTO handcuffed_to_chair
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>Note the final <code>#ENDSCENE</code> delimiter is still required after a <code>#GOTO</code>.
(You can optionally use <code>#END</code> any place you can use <code>#ENDSCENE</code>, too.)</p>

<p>A scene can also end with a statement of the form <code>#GOSUB x #GOTO y</code>
or with a <code>#CONTINUE</code>, which is loosely equivalent to returning from a <code>#GOSUB</code>,
but it can also be used to schedule scenes in a more general way,
e.g. as a queue; see below.</p>

<p>If what you want is for one scene to flow seamlessly into another with
no detectable interruption, use <code>#INCLUDE</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>hair_status = "messy"

#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore.
#INCLUDE messy_hair
#CHOOSE I smash the gates! #FOR electrified
#CHOOSE I walk away #FOR wise_choice
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE messy_hair
#SCENE Your hair is very #[ hair_status #].
#CHOOSE I brush my hair #FOR #( You preen. #{ hair_status = "neat" #} #GOTO #PREVIOUS #)
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>The keyword <code>#PREVIOUS</code> yields the previous scene function, while
<code>#CURRENT</code> gives the current one. Because <code>#GOTO #PREVIOUS</code> is a common construct, this can be shortened to <code>#BACK</code>.</p>

<h2>Scheduling scenes for later</h2>

<p>FunkScene includes a rudimentary scene queue, that you can use to schedule scenes for a later stage.
You don't have to use this queue; as long as you stay away from the keywords <code>#GOSUB</code>, <code>#STACK</code>, <code>#QUEUE</code> and <code>#CONTINUE</code>,
you need never worry about it.
(The queue is useful for some common scheduling patterns, such as side-quests; but to rely too heavily on <code>#GOSUB</code> is to miss
other interesting applications of functional programming patterns to narrative, such as coroutines for parallel plots.)</p>

<p>To make use of the queue, the keywords are <code>#STACK &lt;scene&gt;</code> and <code>#QUEUE &lt;scene&gt;</code>, which can go anywhere in the scene text.
<code>#STACK</code> puts the scene on the front of the scene queue, whereas <code>#QUEUE</code> puts it at the back.
Both will postpone the delayed scene until a scene ending with <code>#CONTINUE</code> is reached.</p>

<p>As an alternative to <code>#STACK</code>, at the end of a scene you can use <code>#GOSUB</code> followed by <code>#GOTO</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE battle
#SCENE You fight valiantly against the stronger opponent.
#GOSUB death_blow
#GOTO afterlife
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE death_blow #( One slip is all it takes. A powerful blow pierces your helmet. It's all over. #)

#PAGE afterlife #( Well, here you are in Heaven. Everything it's cracked up to be. #)
</code></pre>

<p>The following version of the <code>battle</code> scene is exactly equivalent, if a bit cryptic ---
it shows explicitly how <code>#GOSUB</code> pushes its return continuation onto the stack:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE battle
#SCENE You fight valiantly against the stronger opponent.
#STACK afterlife
#GOTO death_blow
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, the following version is also equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE battle
#SCENE You fight valiantly against the stronger opponent.
#FLUSH
#QUEUE death_blow
#QUEUE afterlife
#CONTINUE
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#FLUSH</code> is only necessary if there might be other scenes on the queue already
(its effect is to clear the queue).</p>

<p>Note that you can chain <code>#GOSUB</code> clauses together:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE battle
#SCENE You fight valiantly against the stronger opponent.
#GOSUB death_blow
#GOSUB in_limbo
#GOTO afterlife
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<h2>Implicit continuation</h2>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE in_plane
#SCENE Are you ready?
#CHOOSE Definitely! #FOR #( That's the spirit! #GOTO jump #)
#CHOOSE Just about. #FOR #( Good! #GOTO jump #)
#CHOOSE Maybe... #FOR #( I'll take that as a yes! #GOTO jump #)
#CHOOSE No. #FOR #( Alright, maybe another time. #OVER #)
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE jump
#SCENE You pull the ripcord and jump...
#GOTO free_fall
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>jump</code> scene clearly follows on from the <code>in_plane</code> scene, and most of the choices from <code>in_plane</code> go straight to <code>jump</code>.
There is a simpler way to write passages like this:
you can omit the <code>#ENDSCENE</code> at the end of the first block (<code>in_plane</code>),
along with the <code>#PAGE</code> and <code>#SCENE</code> at the start of the second (<code>jump</code>), so that the two scenes flow together.
Any dead-end choices from the first block will implicitly <code>#GOTO</code> the second block, unless they're explicitly flagged as game-over scenes with <code>#OVER</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE in_plane
#SCENE
Are you ready?
#CHOOSE Definitely! #FOR #( That's the spirit! #)
#CHOOSE Just about. #FOR #( Good! #)
#CHOOSE Maybe... #FOR #( I'll take that as a yes! #)
#CHOOSE No. #FOR #( Alright, maybe another time. #OVER #)
You pull the ripcord and jump...
#GOTO free_fall
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>You can also keep the scenes separate, but specify a default continuation
explicitly, with a <code>#GOTO</code> at the end of the first scene.</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE in_plane
#SCENE Are you ready?
#CHOOSE Definitely! #FOR #( That's the spirit! #)
#CHOOSE Just about. #FOR #( Good! #)
#CHOOSE Maybe... #FOR #( I'll take that as a yes! #)
#CHOOSE No. #FOR #( Alright, maybe another time. #OVER #)
#GOTO jump
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE jump
#SCENE You pull the ripcord and jump...
#GOTO free_fall
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>At the top level (i.e. not within recursively nested <code>#SCENE</code> blocks),
yet another option is to have the scenes flow together (implicit continuation)
but explicitly keep the <code>#PAGE</code> label as well, so you can still <code>#GOTO jump</code>
from elsewhere in the story:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE in_plane
#SCENE Are you ready?
#CHOOSE Definitely! #FOR #( That's the spirit! #)
#CHOOSE Just about. #FOR #( Good! #)
#CHOOSE Maybe... #FOR #( I'll take that as a yes! #)
#CHOOSE No. #FOR #( Alright, maybe another time. #OVER #)
#PAGE jump
You pull the ripcord and jump...
#PAGE free_fall
    You are in free fall.
...
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work within recursively declared blocks, i.e. you cannot combine
<code>#PAGE</code> and implicit continuation except at the top level; in fact, you can't
use <code>#PAGE</code> at all except at the top level.</p>

<p>Here is a longer code excerpt, wherein several scenes are run together using implicit continuations.
Note how you can also use <code>#GOSUB</code> and <code>#INPUT</code> as "hinges" or "conjunctions" between scenes.</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE
Here we go.
#GOSUB are_you_ready
#GOSUB i_hope_so
Better tell me your name.
#INPUT Type your name: #TO name
Hi, #$name.
Time for some choices.
#CHOOSE An irrelevant choice. #FOR #( Hope you're pleased with yourself. #)
#CHOOSE Another irrelevant choice. #FOR #( Completely pointless. #)
#CHOOSE Kill myself. #FOR #( First sensible thing you've said. #OVER #)
Some more scene text.
#CHOOSE A ditzy choice. #FOR #( Squee! #)
#CHOOSE A dumb choice. #FOR #( Woohoo! #)
Even more scene text.
#CHOOSE A terminal choice. #FOR #( YOU ARE DEAD! #)
#CHOOSE A final choice. #FOR #( GAME OVER! #)
#END

#PAGE are_you_ready #( Are you ready?
  #CHOOSE Yes. #FOR #( Great! #CONTINUE #)
  #CHOOSE No. #FOR #( That's too bad! #CONTINUE #) #)

#PAGE i_hope_so #( Seriously, I hope you ARE ready. #CONTINUE #)
</code></pre>

<p>Another useful form of implicit continuation is the <code>#IF...#GOTO...</code> construct:</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE inside_temple
#SCENE
Finally, you are inside the temple. But is your soul pure?
#IF #ACHIEVED penance #GOTO inner_sanctum
Your skin begins to prickle and burn. Flames spring from your clothing.
The reasons for spontaneous human combustion are unclear; it's not even
clear if it is, indeed, a natural phenomenon. However, it's certainly a
supernatural one, and it's also pretty clear the Gods don't like you.
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE inner_sanctum
#SCENE
...
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply the implicit form of the following continuation</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE inside_temple
#SCENE
Finally, you are inside the temple. But is your soul pure?
#GOTO (#ACHIEVED penance ? inner_sanctum : combustion)
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE combustion
#SCENE
Your skin begins to prickle and burn. Flames spring from your clothing.
The reasons for spontaneous human combustion are unclear; it's not even
clear if it is, indeed, a natural phenomenon. However, it's certainly a
supernatural one, and it's also pretty clear the Gods don't like you.
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE inner_sanctum
#SCENE
...
</code></pre>

<h2>One-time choices</h2>

<p>Prefix a choice with <code>#ONCE</code> to indicate that it can only be selected once (after which it will disappear)</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You're on the train to Hell.
#ONCE #CHOOSE I play cards. #FOR #( You play a few games of cards, or was it a few thousand? Before long you're bored. #BACK #)
#ONCE #CHOOSE I play dice. #FOR #( You play some dice games, but quickly lose your money. #BACK #)
#ONCE #CHOOSE Fornicate. #FOR #( CENSORED #BACK #)
#CHOOSE Go to hell #FOR #( Welcome to Hell, sinner. #)
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a group of choices and you want them all to disappear as soon as the player selects one of them, use <code>#AS</code>
to tag them all as belonging to the same group:</p>

<pre><code>#AS penance #CHOOSE As penance, I cross myself. #FOR #( You cross yourself, in penance. #BACK #)
#AS penance #CHOOSE As penance, I regurgitate my last meal. #FOR #( You retch, purging yourself of evil. #BACK #)
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow only one of the two "As penance, I..." choices to be taken.
You can explicitly set these flags using <code>#ACHIEVE penance</code>, you can clear them using <code>#FAIL penance</code>,
and you can test if they're set using the expression <code>#ACHIEVED penance</code>.</p>

<h2>Scenes that cycle through several different descriptions</h2>

<p>The following, as part of a scene, will cycle predictably through several statements about the weather</p>

<pre><code>#CYCLE The wind sighs.
#NEXT A light rain spatters.
#NEXT You feel a chill.
#LOOP
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to stop at the last one, use <code>#STOP</code> instead of <code>#LOOP</code></p>

<pre><code>#CYCLE You saunter into the lobby, drawing sharp glances from the conservatively-dressed bankers.
#NEXT The bankers are pretending not to notice you. You brush some imaginary phlegm off your leather jacket.
#NEXT This bank has gotten used to you. Time to take your punk ass elsewhere.
#STOP
</code></pre>

<p>If you want access to the current state of the cycler, you can give the state variable a name</p>

<pre><code>#CYCLE(wind) The wind sighs.
#NEXT A light rain spatters.
#NEXT You feel a chill.
#LOOP
#SECRETLY #IF wind == 2 #CHOOSE I pull my cloak tighter around me. #FOR #( Wimp. #BACK #)
</code></pre>

<p>The state is an integer starting at zero; so, in the above example, the option to pull the cloak tighter
only appears when the text about feeling a chill has been shown.</p>

<p>Note that there cannot be any whitespace between the <code>#CYCLE</code> and the opening bracket.</p>

<h2>Programmatically generated choice lists</h2>

<p>As well as just generating scene functions directly in JavaScript or FunkScene,
you can build them with a mix of the two,
using <code>#CHOICES</code> to specify the choice list directly</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads "BEWARE!"
#CHOICES
 [["I smash the gates!", electrified],
  ["I walk away", wise_choice]]
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>and mixing <code>#CHOOSE...#FOR...</code> blocks with JavaScript code</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE start
#SCENE You stand before the gates of the Temple of Belsidore. A sign reads "BEWARE!"
#CHOICES
 [["I smash the gates!", electrified],
  #CHOOSE I walk away #FOR wise_choice
 ]
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in a <code>#CHOICES</code> block (and unlike in the usual choice list environment),
you need to specify choice-separating commas and <code>[...]</code> array delimiters explicitly,
even when using <code>#CHOOSE...#FOR</code> blocks to describe individual choices.</p>

<h2>Embedding and interpolating code in text</h2>

<p>To evaluate a JavaScript expression and interpolate the result into text, use</p>

<pre><code>#EVAL &lt;expression&gt; #TEXT
</code></pre>

<p>or the shorter form</p>

<pre><code>#[ &lt;expression&gt; #]
</code></pre>

<p>If all you want is the contents of a JavaScript <code>var</code> then use</p>

<pre><code>#$&lt;varname&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To execute JavaScript statements, use this construct:</p>

<pre><code>#{ &lt;...statements...&gt; #}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>#IF...#THEN...#ELSIF...#ELSIF...#ELSE...#ENDIF</code>
to conditionally display certain pieces of text.</p>

<h2>Text input direct to variables</h2>

<pre><code>name = "Adventurer"

#PAGE start
#SCENE Before we do anything, #$name, how about you tell me your name?
#INPUT Type your name: #TO name #GOTO thanks
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE thanks
#SCENE Thanks, #$name !
#GOTO next
#ENDSCENE

#PAGE next
...
</code></pre>

<p>The general form is always</p>

<pre><code>#PAGE &lt;name of page variable&gt;
#SCENE &lt;...scene text...&gt;
#INPUT &lt;...prompt text...&gt; #TO &lt;name of input variable&gt;
#GOTO &lt;next page&gt;
#ENDSCENE
</code></pre>

<p>No other choices are allowed: it has to be a single text box, and a <code>#GOTO</code>.</p>

<p>This is represented in the JavaScript API as a single choice that is a triple, interpreted as <em>(prompt text, next scene, name of input variable)</em>,
instead of the usual <em>(choice text, next scene)</em> pair.</p>

<h2>JavaScript API</h2>

<p>A scene function is a JavaScript function, taking no arguments,
which (when called) must return an array containing two objects:</p>

<ol>
<li>a text string (the <em>"scene text"</em> ),</li>
<li>an array of choices (the <em>"choice list"</em> ).</li>
</ol>

<p>Each choice in the choice list is itself an array containing (usually)
two objects:</p>

<ol>
<li>a text string (the <em>"choice text"</em> ),</li>
<li>a scene function (the <em>"choice target"</em> ).</li>
</ol>

<p>The JavaScript API has special interpretations for certain edge cases
(the FunkScene keywords <code>#GOTO</code>, <code>#IF</code>, <code>#ONCE</code> etc., make use of these):</p>

<ul>
<li>An empty choice list signifies that the game is over.</li>
<li>If the choice text is an empty string, the choice will be
hidden. (This is used to implement the <code>#GOTO</code> case where no choice
list is to be shown, but the game should still continue, so there
still needs to be a default choice.)</li>
<li>If the choice is an empty array <code>[]</code> instead of a two-element array,
then that choice will not even be displayed. (This is used as a placeholder
for choices that failed a <code>#SECRETLY #IF</code>, <code>#AS</code> or <code>#ONCE</code> test.)</li>
<li>If the choice text is present but the choice target is missing
(i.e. the choice is a one-element array instead of a two-element
array), of if the choice target is <code>undefined</code>, the choice text will be shown
grayed-out and the choice will be disabled. (This is used to implement hints about
choices that could be unlocked, i.e. failed <code>#IF</code> tests.)</li>
<li>If there is only one choice in the choice list, and that choice is a
three-element array instead of the usual two-element array, then
the third element is interpreted as the name of a variable to store
direct text input from the player, as generated by an <code>#INPUT</code> clause.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several helper functions and data structures are defined as methods and members of the <code>FunkScene</code> object in <code>funkscene.js</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>choiceHistory</code> array holds the history of choices (with each choice represented as an integer index into the choice list).</li>
<li>The <code>restore</code> method can be used to replay a history.</li>
<li>The <code>continuationScene</code> method can be overridden to implement a different system for scheduling scenes with <code>#CONTINUE</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>sceneTextToHtml</code> method can be overridden to implement a different text markup.</li>
</ul>
